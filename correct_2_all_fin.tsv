But Origi may have been taken down by Lindel√∂f in the buildup - VAR lets the goal stand?! @ManUtd 1-0 Liverpool! #MUFC #MUNLIV #PL
1185951203445882880	2019-10-20 16:09:35	As Liverpool fans have said this season. If VAR give it then it‚Äôs a goal.  #MUNLIV

1185951122365800448	2019-10-20 16:09:16	"imo that goal should've been overturned. Lindel√∂f clearly kicks Origi so he falls over, then United counters and scores. Bad decision from the VAR team. #MUNLIV"
